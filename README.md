# numerical
Example programs/scripts showing various numerical mathematics procedures.

# Breakdown
The examples are structured by topic area as logically as possible. Of course,
there may exist overlap between topics, but I have tried to place examples
under the "primary" area. 

## Numerical PDEs

## Numerical ODEs

## Vector mathematics

## Random numbers
